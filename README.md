# Uber and Lyft Prices Forecasting
### In this project, I used the dataset containing the Uber and Lyft prices at different time periods

- We know that these cab prices depend on a varity of factors such as distance of travelling, the time at which the cab was booked, the number of passengers, the availability of cabs in the vicinity, weather etc

- For this project, we considered the distance of travelling and the time of order placed for our prediction model

- We used moving average method, exponential smoothing, and Holt's double exponential smoothing to predict the prices
